## 🚀 Run Xaytheon Locally

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Required? | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | ✅ Yes | [Download](https://nodejs.org) |
| **npm** | 9+ | ✅ Yes | Comes with Node.js |
| **Git** | any | ✅ Yes | To clone the repo |
| **Redis** | 7+ | ⬜ Optional | Needed for analytics queue (BullMQ). A Windows binary is included in `redis/` |
| **Docker** | 20+ | ⬜ Optional | Only if you prefer Docker setup |

### Option A — One-Command Setup (Recommended)

Clone the repo and run a single script that installs everything, seeds demo data, and starts the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saatvik-GT/xaytheon.git
cd xaytheon

# macOS / Linux
bash setup.sh

# Windows
.\setup.bat
```

The script will:
1. Check that Node.js 18+ and npm are installed
2. Install root and backend dependencies
3. Create `backend/.env` from `.env.example`
4. Seed the database with demo data (user, watchlists, analytics, etc.)
5. Start the backend dev server on `http://localhost:5000`

Then open the frontend with **VS Code Live Server** (or any static file server) at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.

### Option B — Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone & enter the project
git clone https://github.com/Saatvik-GT/xaytheon.git
cd xaytheon

# 2. Install root dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up the backend
cd backend
npm install

# 4. Create your .env (edit as needed)
cp .env.example .env

# 5. (Optional) Seed demo data for instant dashboards
npm run seed

# 6. Start the backend
npm run dev          # uses nodemon for hot-reload
# or: npm start     # plain node
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser using Live Server or any static server.

### Option C — Docker (includes Redis)

No local Node.js/Redis needed — everything runs in containers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saatvik-GT/xaytheon.git
cd xaytheon

# Create backend .env first
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Build & start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) |
| Backend API | [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) |
| Redis | `localhost:6379` |

### Environment Variables

After setup, edit `backend/.env` to customise your instance:

```env
PORT=5000                              # Backend port
JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_random_string # Auth token secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5500     # Frontend origin (CORS)
API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000          # Backend origin

# GitHub OAuth (optional — for "Login with GitHub")
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
# See SETUP_GITHUB_OAUTH.md for step-by-step instructions
```

> **Tip:** Email variables (`EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_USER`, etc.) are only needed for password-reset emails. You can leave them blank for local development.

### Demo Data & Credentials

Running `npm run seed` (or the setup script) creates a ready-to-use demo account:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `demo@xaytheon.dev` |
| Password | `demo1234` |

The seed script also populates:
- 📋 A **"Trending Repos" watchlist** with 5 popular repositories
- 📊 **30 days of analytics snapshots** (stars, followers, commits)
- 🔔 **Sample notifications** (stars, forks, issues, PRs)
- 🏆 **Starter achievements** (Welcome Aboard, Watcher, etc.)

This means dashboards will display meaningful data immediately — no GitHub token required.

### Redis (Optional)

Redis is required for the background analytics queue (BullMQ). If Redis isn't running, the backend still starts — but queued analytics jobs won't process.

**Quick start:**
```bash
# Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis

# Windows (included binary)
redis\redis-server.exe
```
